     <h1> Yana Khusanova </h1>
     <p> Hello and welcome to my page! I am a PostDoc at Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, working in "Supermassive Black Holes and Galaxies in the epoch of reionization" group.

     <h1> Research </h1>
     <p>In the first Gyr since the Big Bang, the Universe went through a major phase transition: primordial gas was reionized by the light from the first galaxies. In the same time, supermassive black holes were growing in the centers of these galaxies, accreting material at extremely high rate. Black holes and galaxies reciprocally affect the evolution of each other and in my research I am using observations to study details of this co-evolution.

        <b>Star Formation History of the Universe.</b>
        <br>Constraining star formation rate density (SFRD) at high redshift (z>4) is challenging. Most of the time, we have to rely on photometric redshifts and uncertain dust corrections. Using the data from VIMOS UltraDeep Survey, I provided <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...634A..97K/abstract">constraints on the SFRD</a> from a sample of galaxies with secure spectroscopic redshift and two different SFR tracers: UV luminosity and Lya emission. To overcome the difficulties related to the dust corrections, I used the ALMA Large Program to Investigate C+ at Early Times (ALPINE). Using stacking of mm continuum images, I measured <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...649A.152K/abstract">the dust obscured SFRD at z~4.5 and z~5.5.</a> In the near future, I am planing to continue working on obtaining robust SFRD constraints in the early Universe <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information.html?id=2234">using JWST data.</a>
        <br><br>
        <b> Host galaxies of radio-loud quasars.</b>
        <br>SMBH play an important role in regulating star formation in their host galaxies. The feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) can be both positive and negative. Observing quasar host galaxies and determining their properties is important to understand how AGN affect the evolution of galaxies. In particular, I am interested how the presence of radio jets affects star formation. For that, I use NOEMA observations of [CII] and CO lines and underlying continuum.

     <h1> Teaching </h1>
     <p> In 2014, I received an additional qualification in pedagogy at the Center for Pedagogical Education of the Ural Federal University (Ekaterinburg, Russia). As pedagogical practice, I was preparing lessons and teaching astronomy in high school Nr. 9 in Ekaterinburg. Later, I was also helping to prepare the students from the same school for astronomy contests.

        <h1> Public Outreach </h1></p>
        <p style = "margin-left: 0.vw">
        I love to talk to people about science, whenever the opportunity comes up in any language I speak at least at A2 level.<br><br>
        Apart from casual chats, sometimes I give talks and interviews. Here is an overview:
        <br><br>
        <b>In Esperanto language:</b>
         <ul>
        <li><p style = "margin-left: 0.vw">"Enigmas of galaxy evolution" (2016) and "Astrophysicists and climate change" (2020) at the conference on the Application of Esperanto in Science and Technologies</p>
        <li><p style = "margin-left: 0.vw">Interview for a podcast about galaxies <a href="https://kern.punkto.info/2016/12/14/kp102-galaksioj/">kern.punkto.info</a></p>
        <li><p style = "margin-left: 0.vw">Online talk "Galaxy evolution" for Esperanto Astronomy Day</p>
        </ul>
        <p style = "margin-left: 0.vw">...and other undocumented talks and discussions during Esperanto events.</p>
